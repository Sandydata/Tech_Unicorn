# **Project Title: Tech Unicorns by Country - Data Analysis**
This project provides data visualization for the top 10 countries with the most unicorn companies.

## **Description**
The dataset includes the number of unicorn companies, their total valuation in billions, and the population, IMF GDP, and GDP per capita of each country. The data has been visualized using Tableau, and the resulting dashboard provides a clear and concise overview of the unicorn landscape in each country.

## **My Journey**
As a data analyst, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. My main goal was to find meaningful relationships between three different datasets and create compelling visualizations using Tableau.

In this project, I leveraged the power of SQL to perform data manipulation and cleaning tasks. To achieve this, I utilized various SQL functions like JOIN(), aggregate function, and window function to combine and summarize the data. JOIN() function helped me to combine data from multiple tables based on common columns, while aggregate functions like COUNT() and SUM() helped me to summarize the data. Additionally, I used window functions like RANK() to perform calculations on subsets of data within a table, enabling me to generate the rank of countries based on the number of unicorn companies. These techniques not only enabled me to clean and transform the data effectively but also showcased my technical skills in SQL.

The three datasets were about unicorn companies, population, and GDP of different countries. I wanted to understand the relationship between the number of unicorn companies, their total valuation, and the economic health of different countries.

After cleaning and manipulating the data, I imported it into Tableau and created several visualizations to illustrate the findings. I used a bar graph to show the top 10 countries with the highest number of unicorns, and another bar graph to show the total valuation of unicorns in each of these countries. I also created scatter plots to show the relationship between GDP per capita and the number of unicorns in each country.

One interesting finding was that the United States had the highest number of unicorn companies and the highest total valuation, while Israel had the fewest unicorn companies but the highest GDP per capita. This finding suggests that the number of unicorn companies in a country is not necessarily indicative of its economic strength.

Overall, this project allowed me to showcase my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using SQL and Tableau. The findings can provide valuable insights for businesses and investors looking to understand the unicorn landscape in different countries and make informed decisions.

The dashboard includes bar charts showing the number of unicorns, total valuation, population, and GDP per capita for each country. The data can be filtered by country and sorted by any of the metrics.
